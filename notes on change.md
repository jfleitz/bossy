Goalie creates new white shots to be lit up
Have it configured to number of shots that are lit in the beginning
GOAL targets reset when all down or per ball


Lights at bottom:

Letters - lit by hitting the white shots only when lit
5000 lit shots - Each time all of the GOAL targets are knocked down completely

# of goals X Lit shots is bonus

The 2 White middle lights - When you completey all MIKE BOSSY letters, one of the lights gets lit


TBD:
Should we track shots on goal?
Corner shot - what about this
