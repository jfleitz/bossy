# Overview
Since there is lack of a display on the pinball machine, clarity needs to be given to the breakdown of why a player received a score due to end of ball bonuses.

Scoring that is not represented well on the playfield:

+ Hat Trick - At least 3 goals made by the same flipper within the same game
+ Puck Count / MIKE BOSSY bonus collects - Total lit pucks that were collected in the entire game, broken down by period (ball)
+ Overtime second count - In the 3rd period, the total number of overtime targets collected (each representing a second)



What to discplay:
+ Total number of teams
+ Current Score

Events:
"Puck passed to Trottier"
"Puck passed to Gillies"
"Puck passed to Bossy"
"Puck controlled by Islanders"

"Goal by Trottier"

"Blocked Goal Attempt" - by goalie
"Puck steal" - when hitting bumpers
