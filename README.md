Game Plan Mike Bossy pinball machine utilizing the goflip library.

## Introduction
The Mike Bossy pinball machine never made it to production. There was one made for the 1982 AMOA show (confirmed - Roger Sharpe wrote a review of it for  Play Meter magazine Feb 15,1982), however it doesn't match what the flyer said the game was going to be, and the review didn't make it sound like it was "a true Hockey experience".

The original roms cannot be found. There are a few "Bossy game roms" floating out there, but they are garbage and don't boot. Therefore, the game is being redone keeping hockey feel in mind that the flyer calls out, without making any changes to the playfield design.

## Overview of Rules
The playfield layout is very basic, like a hockey rink! You are the islanders. The defense (Must be penguins or bruins, since black and yellow) is the goalie, pop bumpers and kickers. You are playing with the Trio Grande line; the bottom flippers are Bryan Trottier and Clark Gillies, with Mike Bossy as the top right flipper.

## Spots
* The use of the white spots on the playfield is used for lighting up the shot you need to make with the puck. All spots are lit up at the beginning of the ball. Hitting a lit "puck shot" awards the next letter in the M-I-K-E B-O-S-S-Y bonus bank, and the white spot will be turned off.

* Ths top saucer is Mr. Bossy himself, and awards 300 points. Immediately hitting a goal,all spotted letters will be collected X1000 points.

## Goalie
Don't hit the goalie! Each time you hit the goalie a letter is taken back from the letter bank and a spot is turned on the playfield. You are awarded 1000 points for the Shot on Goal. 

## Goals
* A goal is scored by hitting one of the drop targets down behind the goalie, or the back behind the drop targets.

* Scoring a goal awards you 500 points. The number of goals scored during your ball is used in the end of ball bonus.

* Hitting all drop targets down during a ball awards a 5000 point bonus, and adds 5000 points to your bonus.
* On the third drop target bank completion, special is lit.

## End of Ball Bonus
* At the end of a ball, you are rewarded a 1000 point bonus for each Letter spotted. You can complete the letter bank up to 3 times (27 letters), designated by the two White indicators below the M-I-K-E B-O-S-S-Y letters.

* A goal scored is treated as a bonus multiplier. Therefore, if you scored 2 goals and had 8 letters spotted, you will get 2 goals X 8 letters X 1000 points = 16000 for your bonus from the Spotted Letters.

* 5000 points will be added to your bonus for each G-O-A-L target bank completion. Up to 9 Goals (45000 points) are indicated by the bonus lights

## Additional Period info
* 9 second warm up period - This is from the original game. Basically a ball save for 9 seconds. You can't hit a goal at this time (or it won't count). It allows you to collect letters though without a goalie taking them away from you.

* Overtime awards. On the last ball, the overtime lights are lit. For each time you hit one, 1 second is added to the overtime. If there are more than one player playing, whomever has the higher overtime value gets the timed extra ball.

### Things to work out
* Add Goalie servo control based on which targets are standing
